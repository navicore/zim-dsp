# Envelope -> VCA test
# Demonstrates oscillator through VCA with envelope modulation

# Create an oscillator at 440Hz
vco: osc sine 440

# Create an envelope generator with 10ms attack, 500ms decay
env: env 0.01 0.5

# Create a VCA with unity gain
vca: vca 1.0

# Route oscillator through VCA
vca <- vco

# Output from VCA
out <- vca

# The envelope is automatically detected and applied to modulate the VCA

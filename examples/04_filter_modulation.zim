# Filter modulation example
# Demonstrates LFO modulating filter cutoff frequency

vco: osc saw 110      # Sawtooth wave at 110 Hz
lfo: osc sine 0.5     # LFO at 0.5 Hz
vcf: filter 1000 0.7  # Filter with 1kHz cutoff, 0.7 resonance

# Audio routing
vcf.audio <- vco.saw

# Modulation routing with scaling and offset
# LFO sweeps filter cutoff between 500 Hz and 2500 Hz
vcf.cutoff <- lfo.sine * 1000 + 1500

# Output the filtered signal
out <- vcf.lp  # Use lowpass output

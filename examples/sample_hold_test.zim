# Simple Sample and Hold Test
# LFO provides both the signal to sample and the gate trigger

lfo: lfo 0.5  # Slow LFO as signal source
clock: lfo 4  # Faster clock for sampling

# Sample and hold
sh: samplehold
sh.signal <- lfo.sine    # Sample the LFO sine wave
sh.gate <- clock.gate    # Trigger sampling with clock

# Use the held value to control oscillator frequency
osc: osc saw
osc.freq <- sh.out * 200 + 440  # Map to 240-640 Hz range

# Output with some attenuation
out <- osc.saw * 0.3

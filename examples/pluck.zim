# Plucked string simulation
# Oscillator through VCA with envelope for pluck effect

# Create a saw wave oscillator at 220Hz (A3)
vco: osc saw 220

# Create envelope with fast attack for pluck
env: env 0.001 1.0  # 1ms attack, 1s decay

# Create VCA for amplitude control
vca: vca 0.7

# Route oscillator through VCA
vca <- vco

# Output from VCA
out <- vca
